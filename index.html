    <h2>My Favorite Food: Biryani</h2>

    <p>I absolutely love <strong>Biryani</strong> because of its <strong>rich flavors</strong> and delicious blend of spices. 
    The combination of tender meat, aromatic rice, and mouth-watering masala makes it an unforgettable dish. 
    Itâ€™s a perfect mix of tradition, taste, and comfort food!</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Movie</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite movies is <strong>RRR</strong>. Directed by S. S. Rajamouli, it is an epic action drama that showcases the story of two revolutionaries fighting against British rule in India. 
    The film is packed with intense action sequences, powerful storytelling, and outstanding performances. I especially admire the performance of <strong>N. T. Rama Rao Jr.</strong>, who plays Komaram Bheem with great intensity and emotion.</p>
